/**
 * A namespace for all the data types that represent a catalog of medications.
 * At the highest level of organization are categories, each of which contains
 * a list of drugs, each of which is associated with a list of formats.
 *
 * A Category is a group of drugs that are administered in the same general
 * fashion (e.g. orally, by injection, by infusion, or externally); thus the
 * category determines the set of possible administration routes (e.g. for the
 * injectable category, the possible routes are IV, SC, and IM).  The category
 * also determines the form in which a dosage is specified (e.g. as a single
 * amount given at once, or as an amount of liquid given continuously over a
 * period of time), which we call a DosingType.
 *
 * A Drug is a substance, or what is sometimes called an "active ingredient"
 * (e.g. aspirin is a drug).  A combination of substances is also considered
 * a drug (e.g. artemether-lumefantrine is a drug).  Each drug may have zero
 * or more captions, which are hints to the user about the therapeutic function
 * of the drug (e.g. "analgesic") to help reduce the likelihood of error.  When
 * the same substance exists in multiple categories (e.g. amoxicillin can be
 * taken orally or injected), there is a separate Drug object in each category.
 *
 * A Format is a formulation of a drug, i.e. the manner in which the substance
 * is prepared for administration.  A format typically specifies the size and
 * mechanism of a unit of delivery (e.g. 300 mg tablets, drops, puffs), or a
 * concentration of the substance in solution (e.g. glucose 5%).  The format
 * determines the dosage unit, i.e. the unit in which doses are prescribed
 * (e.g. number of tablets, milligrams of liquid).
 *
 * Thus, the data structure hierarchy is as follows:
 *
 *         Category (dosingType, routes)
 *            -->* Drug (captions)
 *                  -->* Format (unit)
 *
 * Every Category, Drug, Format, Route, and Unit has a "code", a short, unique,
 * language-independent string identifier, which is used for serialization.
 *
 * In the MSF scheme, each Category has a four-letter code that is a prefix of
 * the Drug code, and each Drug has an eight-letter code that is a prefix of
 * the Format code.  However, these prefix relationships are not used by any
 * application logic.
 *
 * Note that, currently, we use stock codes as Format codes, which conflates
 * the formulation of drugs with the ordering of drug supplies.  This design
 * issue is as yet unresolved.
